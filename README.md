## 🧭 My Journey

I was born in 1992 into a humble, education-driven family in Vietnam. I was fortunate enough to attend one of the top universities in the country — the Military Technical Academy. But after three years, I made a bold and difficult decision: I dropped out to support myself and my family.

That choice led me through many different paths — working as a kitchen assistant, parking attendant, karaoke staff, factory worker, and electronics assembler. It was a tough phase, but one that taught me resilience and grit.

Eventually, I took a leap of faith and began an internship in programming — despite knowing almost nothing about code.

## 🚀 My First Break

I got my first chance at **NTQ Solution**, where I met the mentor who changed my life. Instead of criticizing what I lacked, he gave me a chance and taught me from scratch. It was there that I fell in love with software development and learned:

- 🐍 Python  
- 🧩 Odoo  
- ⚛️ ReactJS  

During this time, I also found love and started a family. Yes, NTQ was where I got my first job — and also my first child.

## 🧱 Building Foundations at VTI Group

In 2019, I joined **VTI Group** with a new purpose: to grow and contribute.

- I developed internal systems using **Odoo ERP**
- Built modules to support corporate management
- Worked on multiple ERP projects for external clients

I learned how to scale systems, work across teams, and handle real business challenges.

## 💼 Becoming a Leader at Sojitz Tech-Innovation VIETNAM

Despite warnings from friends due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I took another leap — I applied to **Sojitz Tech-Innovation VIETNAM**.

After a rigorous test and three rounds of interviews, I was offered a role as **Software Development Team Leader**. Within just two months, I was promoted and received a raise based on performance.

It was an unforgettable experience that strengthened my belief in taking smart risks.

**(2022–2023)**

## 🔄 Full Circle: Returning to VTI

Sometimes, the heart brings you home. After over a year at Sojitz, I was invited back to **VTI**, this time not for internal development, but for one of their **largest client projects**.

It felt like a full-circle moment — not as a beginner, but as a leader and contributor with purpose.

**(2023 – Present)**
