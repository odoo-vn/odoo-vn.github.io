      <p class="lead">Hi there! I'm <strong>Quang</strong> (찐 반 광) — thank you for stopping by! I'm happy you're here, and I'd love to share a bit about myself and my journey as a developer.</p>

      <h2 class="text-primary">🧭 My Journey</h2>
      <p>I was born in 1992 into a humble, education-driven family in Vietnam. I was fortunate enough to attend one of the top universities in the country — the Military Technical Academy. But after three years, I made a bold and difficult decision: I dropped out to support myself and my family.</p>
      <p>That choice led me through many different paths — working as a kitchen assistant, parking attendant, karaoke staff, factory worker, and electronics assembler. It was a tough phase, but one that taught me resilience and grit.</p>
      <p>Eventually, I took a leap of faith and began an internship in programming — despite knowing almost nothing about code.</p>

      <h2 class="text-primary">🚀 My First Break</h2>
      <p>I got my first chance at <strong>NTQ Solution</strong>, where I met the mentor who changed my life. Instead of criticizing what I lacked, he gave me a chance and taught me from scratch. It was there that I fell in love with software development and learned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🐍 Python</li>
        <li>🧩 Odoo</li>
        <li>⚛️ ReactJS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>During this time, I also found love and started a family. Yes, NTQ was where I got my first job — and also my first child. <strong>(2017–2019)</strong></p>
