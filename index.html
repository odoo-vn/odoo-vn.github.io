  <h2>My Journey</h2>
  <p>I was born in 1992 into a humble, education-driven family in Vietnam. I was fortunate enough to attend one of the top universities in the country — the Military Technical Academy. But after three years, I made a bold and difficult decision: I dropped out to support myself and my family.</p>

  <p>That choice led me through many different paths — working as a kitchen assistant, parking attendant, karaoke staff, factory worker, and electronics assembler. It was a tough phase, but one that taught me resilience and grit.</p>

  <p>Eventually, I took a leap of faith and began an internship in programming — despite knowing almost nothing about code.</p>

  <h2>My First Break</h2>
  <p>I got my first chance at <strong>NTQ Solution</strong>, where I met the mentor who changed my life. Instead of criticizing what I lacked, he gave me a chance and taught me from scratch. It was there that I fell in love with software development and learned:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Odoo</li>
    <li>ReactJS</li>
  </ul>
  <p>During this time, I also found love and started a family. Yes, NTQ was where I got my first job — and also my first child.</p>
  <p><strong>2017–2019</strong></p>

  <h2>Building Foundations at VTI Group</h2>
  <p>In 2019, I joined <strong>VTI Group</strong> with a new purpose: to grow and contribute.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Developed internal systems using Odoo ERP</li>
    <li>Built modules to support corporate management</li>
    <li>Worked on multiple ERP projects for external clients</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>2019–2022</strong></p>

  <h2>Becoming a Leader at Sojitz Tech-Innovation VIETNAM</h2>
  <p>Despite warnings from friends during the COVID-19 pandemic, I applied to Sojitz Tech-Innovation VIETNAM.</p>
  <p>After a rigorous test and three interviews, I was offered a role as Software Development Team Leader. Within two months, I was promoted and received a raise based on performance.</p>
  <p><strong>2022–2023</strong></p>

  <h2>Returning to VTI</h2>
  <p>After over a year at Sojitz, I was invited back to VTI, this time to contribute to one of their largest client projects.</p>
  <p><strong>2023 – Present</strong></p>
